<h2>Project 1: making sounds with your name</h2>
<p>For this project, we used MaxMSP to have different sounds play when inputting our name. For this, I just used some samples from a synth on FL Studio. </p>

<h2>Project 2: making sounds with JavaScript</h2>
<p>For this asssignment, we were tasked with learning how to integrate audio into a webpage with HTML and JavaScript. For this, I've added a script to this page itself.
  My goal here is to have the same kind of sounds working in the same kind of way as Project 1: just type in my name, E-T-H-A-N, and you should be able to play
  Samples of notes C, D, E, F, and G, respectively. Give it a shot! </p>

<h2>Project 3: Using MIDI to control sound/music</h2>
<p>For this assignment, we used Max along with a MIDI controller to control sounds. For this, I used a tri~ object as the base, and added some fun ways to control
  the sound. For example, you can control the amplitude of the wave by hitting the keys softer or lighter, and the pitch and modulation wheels do exactly what you'd
  think they do. It's pretty basic and not very interesting to talk about, but still, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish with it. It probably gave me more 
  of a headache than it should have, though!</p>

<h2>Project 4: Algorithmic Composition</h2>
<p>This assignment had us create a program that generates music in a rhythmic way. For this, I used Max to make a program that can play several chords in MIDI,
  and then plays more notes randomly based on those chords. Basically, there's a set of notes possible for each chord, and the note played is chosen randomly from
  that set. I made options so that you can make the chords play in a progression that I've set, or also make them random. Sometimes the melody the algorithm ends up
  Playing is pretty nice, but if I had more time I'd like to add more possible chords for the program to play around with.</p>

<h2>Project Progress Report</h2>
<p>So far, I've been able to set up a method where all the user has to do is click a button, and it switches what instrument is playing. Click the button below
  the instrument, and it'll switch to instrument number 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Also, a unique animation plays for each instrument. With all of these, it's possible
  to set up a little performance! I set most of this up using Max logic and objects like ggates and gswitches, some if statements, and a ton of cords. I also used
  a metronome and fpic for the animations, and I used some simple math to get the animations to play in sync to the tempo. The next big thing to accomplish would be
  to set up different mixers for each instrument: things like panning, reverb, chorus, flanger, or other effects like that. Some of my instruments already have these
  effects applied, so I might have to re-record them completely dry. Also, I want to make it so that you can change the tempo of the playback, and the animations will
  slow down too. I think I can do that with some simple math. Finally, the only other thing I have to do is make an animation for when an instrument is off, and make
  sure that all the different animations are synced up perfectly. I think progress is going pretty well!</p>

<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p>My final project is complete! It follows the rules that I laid out in my original proposal, allowing users to mix and match instruments and efects to create their
  own unique version of a song! You can check it out along with its user manual here:</p>
