<h2>Project 1: making sounds with your name</h2>
<p>For this project, we used MaxMSP to have different sounds play when inputting our name. For this, I just used some samples from a synth on FL Studio. </p>

<h2>Project 2: making sounds with JavaScript</h2>
<p>For this asssignment, we were tasked with learning how to integrate audio into a webpage with HTML and JavaScript.
  My goal here is to have the same kind of sounds working in the same kind of way as Project 1: just type in my name, E-T-H-A-N, and you should be able to play
  Samples of notes C, D, E, F, and G, respectively. Give it a shot! </p>

  document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (even.keyCode === 69) {
      theSound.play();
      console.log("You pressed the E key");
