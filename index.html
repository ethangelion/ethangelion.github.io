<h2>Project 1: making sounds with your name</h2>
<p>For this project, we used MaxMSP to have different sounds play when inputting our name. For this, I just used some samples from a synth on FL Studio. </p>

<h2>Project 2: making sounds with JavaScript</h2>
<p>For this asssignment, we were tasked with learning how to integrate audio into a webpage with HTML and JavaScript.
  My goal here is to have the same kind of sounds working in the same kind of way as Project 1: just type in my name, E-T-H-A-N, and you should be able to play
  Samples of notes C, D, E, F, and G, respectively. Give it a shot! </p>

<h2>Project 3: Using MIDI to control sound/music<\h2>
<p>For this assignment, we used Max along with a MIDI controller to control sounds. For this, I used a tri~ object as the base, and added some fun ways to control
  the sound. For example, you can control the amplitude of the wave by hitting the keys softer or lighter, and the pitch and modulation wheels do exactly what you'd
  think they do. It's pretty basic and not very interesting to talk about, but still, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish with it. It probably gave me more 
  of a headache than it should have, though!</p>
